About
===
If you're working on a microservice like project, and your using PACT for contrqct testing, you probobly came across the issue of comunication between the developers of consumers (clients) and providers (backend). Having a mechanisem which is able to create api documentations from the pushed/generated contracts live in the pipeline, can perform a very helpful role. 
PactDoc, is a java commandline tool, capable of generating api documents in such way. It also have a contract varifier tool which can verify generated pact contracts agains any convention you have in mind for your developers while writing pact tests. Its easy to use an can be easily runned on travis containers and gitlab runners.

Features
===

* Generate Markdown documents for pact contracts in cicd pipe line
* Updating repository based wikis like github or gitlab wikis.
* Verifying generated pact contracts against any custome convention by plugging a custome jar library.
* Determine the levels and the structure of the documentation directory tree.


How To Use
===

The following shows some examples of using PactDoc. in all examples, it's considered that you have extracted the contents of binary package in a directory named _PactDoc_ under the root of your project directory.

Update/Generate __Gitlab__ Repository Wiki
---

```bash
	PactDoc/pactdoc updatewiki --gitlab-wiki cicdtest Acidmanic --pass <your-gitlab-password>
```
This command will pull your gitlab wiki for given project, then generates the wiki markdown files the way that gitlab will dispay correctly. then commits and updates the wiki repo with new files.


Update/Generate __Github__ Repository Wiki
---

```bash
	PactDoc/pactdoc updatewiki --github-wiki cicdtest Acidmanic --pass <your-github-password>
```

Usage is same as gitlab. but this time the command will generate wiki all wiki markdown files, alongside each other. because currently github will show and link the files like their all in the same path. so for links to work, it's best to put all the files in the same directory at first place.

__Other__ Git Based Wiki Repositories
---

If your wiki repository is not github or gitlab, you can still use the UpdateWiki command. but you had to provide more information. you can run the command with --help argument to see all the options.

```bash
	PactDoc/pactdoc updatewiki --help
```


__ ‚úã Not The Root Directory!!__

If you don't want the command to put wiki files in the wiki root, you can append --apis-sub-dir &lt;dir-name&gt;. this way all wiki files will be put on the given directory.


Generate a static HTML Wiki
---

```bash
	PactDoc/pactdoc generatewiki --format html
```

You can see all details for this command by running 

```bash
	PactDoc/pactdoc generatewiki --help
```

This command will generate an html wiki in a directory named _wiki_. if you want the wiki to be created in other path, you can specify it by appending --output &lt;output-path&gt;.


 üéÅ How to Get
===

You can download the file binary-package.zip from [latest release](https://github.com/Acidmanic/PactDoc/releases/latest) page. and extract it to  your project root to be called easily from cicd scripts. 

After you download the binaries package, you can run the file ./pactdoc on unix based platforms or pactdoc in windows platforms.


 You need to have _java_ comand available on your comman line environment. If 
```bash 
	java -version
``` 
prints out something like:
```bash
	java version "1.8.0_45"
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_45-b14)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.45-b02, mixed mode)
```
,then you're good to go.



üëæ Note
----

This is possible that the application details change through the updates, so consider using a the same release version or, check for changes when your using this in your cicd projects.
